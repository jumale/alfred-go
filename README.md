# Alfred Go

A Golang app with a set of commands for MacOS Alfred.

Work in progress...

## Why?

I want to have all my custom complex Alfred commands in one place.
By complex I mean all commands which require writing custom scripts, bigger than
just few lines.
This app should provide CLI for all such commands, and then Alfred work-flows would
contain only callings the app.
